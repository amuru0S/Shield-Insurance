## 🎯𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞

As a Data Analyst, I have been tasked to build an end-to-end Power BI project with an in-depth analysis provided on the data by AtliQ. I have to create an effective dashboard for Shield Insurance company, which would help them in making data-driven decisions by going through the analysis from the month of November 2022 to April 2023.

Insights & Recommendations-
Age Group Analysis:
Maximum Revenue: The 31-40 age group generates the highest revenue.

## Recommendations:
### 👉Focus on the Cities and Age Group:
* Tailor policies to attract the 41-50 and 65+ age groups, considering their specific preferences.
* Offline agents generate the most revenue. Online app and website sales have grown since February 2023.
* Indore and Chennai are lagging in terms of policies, so these cities should primarily focus on marketing efforts, special promotions to attract more people and for the eventual business growth.
* Connecting with young adults prominently raise awareness. Focus on understanding their preferences in order to the current marketing strategies.
Take advantage of buying and selling products online through apps and websites. Digital shopping is the best way to attract more customers. Create user-friendly platforms that make it easy for customers to interact with the products. So, focusing on Digital Channels could lead to enormous growth of the Business.

### 👉Improve customer support and features on the online app and website.
* Implement a system where customers receive policy suggestions based on the details they provide to boost the online platform's popularity.
* Delhi NCR leads in revenue and customer base, followed by Mumbai and Hyderabad.
* Apply successful strategies from Delhi NCR, Mumbai, and Hyderabad to other cities to increase overall revenue.
* The POL2005HEL policy stood out as a top policy that generates the highest revenue.
* Develop variations of the POL2005HEL policy to attract a wider customer base. Offer different options to enhance the appeal of the policy.
* As in-person sales are dropping, we need to revitalize Offline sales by rewarding sales agents through better commissions and other incentives, to make them feel more motivated, which in turn helps to boost their sales.
